THIS IS A SIMPLE SPEECH RECOGITION SYSTEM TASK,IN THIS I DESIGNED A CIRCUIT DIAGRAM WHICH WILL  WORK BY GIVEING  COMMANDS TO TURN ON OR OFF THE DEVICES.IN THIS TASK BY USING BLUETOOTH THE DEVICES WILL BE TURN ON OR OFF BY SPEECH RECOGINITION ACCORDING TO THAT I DESIGNED A CIRCUIT DIAGRAM IN TINKERCAD.BUT IN TINKERCAD THE HC-05 BLUETOOTH DOES NOT SUPPORT IN  TINKERCAD.THE COMPONENTS USED ARE ARDUNIO,LED,RESISTOR,BREAD BOARD,CONNECTING WIRES.IN THIS PROJECT,I USED AN ARDUNIO UNO AND SIMULATED THE VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM USING A LED AND SERIAL MONITOR IN TINKERCAD  BECAUSE REAL SPEECH RECOGNITION MODULES LIKE THE ELECHOUSE VOICE RECOGNITION MODULE V3 ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN SIMULATOR.IN ACTUAL IMPLEMENTION,THE VOICE RECOGNITION MODULE LISTEN FOR SPOKEN COMMANDS AND SEND A UNIQUE SIGNAL OR CODE TO THE ARDUINO WHEN A TRAINED COMMAND IS RECOGNIZED.THE ARDUNIO WOULD THEN ACT UPON THE COMMAND AND CONTROL AN OUTPUT DEVICE,SUCH AS TURNING ON OR OFF AN LED OR APPLIANCE.SINCE SPEECH MODULES ARE UNAVAILABLE IN TINKERCAD, I WROTE A CODE WHICH WILL DELIVER THE VOICE  COMMAND IN SERIAL MONITOR.BY GIVING THE COMMANDS LIKE TURN ON  IN SERIAL MONITOR THEN THE LED WILL GLOW AND GIVING TURN OFF THE LED WILL NOT GLOW.THE DELIVERABLES FOR THIS TASK INCLUDE THE ARDUNIO CODE FILE,CIRCUIT DIAGRAM AND OUTPUT SCREENSHOTS SHOWING THE LED CONTROL.ALL THE FILES ARE UPLOADED IN GITHUB REPOSITORY.THIS TASK IS VERY USEFUL IN REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS SUCH AS SMART HOMES,VOICE-CONTROLLED APPLIANCES,AND ACCESSIBILITY TOOLS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.THIS TASK GAVE ME A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF  HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTION AND HOW VOICE RECOGNITION CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO EMBEDDED SYSTEMS.
